			<h1><u>Technical</u> <u>Skills</u></h1>
		</header>
		<main>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h2>Communication:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Strong communication skills are important in nearly every aspect of life,
						especially in the workforce. This is a universal, important skill that will help you positively
						interact with your colleagues as you assist and interact with others about technology-related
						concepts. You may work as a developer, engineer or system administrator in a team of people. IT
						professionals not only communicate constantly with members of their team, but they also
						communicate with the other departments of a company and with people outside the company. From
						staff meetings to one-on-one tech support calls to conversations with your colleagues, there is
						always an opportunity to communicate. Ensure that you do it well.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Coding:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Knowledge of coding is a foundational requirement for most IT professionals.
						Depending on the position, you'll want to have some basic knowledge of coding languages like
						HTML and C++. Some positions may require you to know advanced languages like Python, JavaScript,
						Amazon Web Services (AWS) or possibly TensorFlow. You'll likely get experience with these types
						of languages through continued education, hands-on experience and training for advanced
						certifications.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Project management:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Having many ongoing projects is typical in the IT department. Being able to
						manage your workload efficiently will illustrate your ability to multitask in a way that helps
						you meet deadlines, reach goals and resolve issues. Having solid project management skills
						appeals to employers in most career fields because it means that time and money are used
						appropriately.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Leadership:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Some people are intimidated by leading when it doesn't come naturally to them.
						However, don't let your fears discourage you. Leadership can be learned by first helping others
						who need assistance with a tough concept or duty. Being friendly and willing to help prepares
						you for bigger tasks like giving a presentation or leading a group discussion. It's all about
						taking small steps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Organization:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Being organized at work will help you become an efficient employee. Companies
						hire those who demonstrate great organizational skills because it means they know how to perform
						their work well and on schedule. Every day at work presents new challenges that will test your
						ability to manage your workload. If you're organized, you'll positively demonstrate your
						productivity levels and be known as a valuable employee, which may lead to a raise or promotion
						in the future.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Members of the IT department are known to have strong troubleshooting or
						problem-solving skills. Whenever people run into tech-related issues that stop them from working
						or doing the things they love, they'll call tech support if they can't figure it out themselves.
						You may be working with difficult algorithms that take some time. This is where your technical
						knowledge and years of hands-on experience will really help you find the solutions you need.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Curiosity:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Your desire to learn new things will guide your career to greater levels of
						success. If you remain curious, you will naturally want to seek the answers to the things you
						want to know. Curiosity leads you to new discoveries, which educates you further on particular
						concepts in technology. Once you fully understand how something operates, you can get right to
						the source of confusion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Resourcefulness:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Knowing what resources you have and how to use them is a great skill to have as
						an IT professional. You may be limited on budget, time or another element outside of your
						control. But with the right resources, you can overcome any obstacles preventing you from your
						project goals. Resourcefulness can enhance not only your work experience but that of your
						colleagues, as you'll want to share with them what you've learned.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Perseverance:</h2>
					<p class="birdman">Most people in the workforce need some level of perseverance to be successful at
						what they do. Without a challenge, there is rarely a change. When the time comes for an
						interview, you'll want to tell your potential employer that you're not afraid to take on bigger
						projects or learn new things. When you continue working toward a resolution, you'll find the
						success that keeps you going.</p>
